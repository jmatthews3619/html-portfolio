<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Good day, and welcome to my portfolio website. I am Jason Matthews and  I am a web developer in the Metropolitan New York City area.</p>

<p>My professional experience has been in consumer and business banking, residential 
  and commercial mortgage finance, and cash logistic specializing in ATM settlement 
  and replenishment. My Web Development journey started with being fustrated at using 
  a template to build a website, but not be able to make it the way I want it. I also 
  did not like the fact that I could not fix any issues on my own. Thus, I decided to 
  take a indepth course in web development and the rest is history.  </p>

<p>When I'm not working on a project, I'm an avid photographer, writer and I love learning 
  Salsa dancing with going to Salsa socials. I am lucky to be a New Yorker because there
are so many ethnic resturants to choose from and any given weekend I am trying my share of ethnic
foods within New York City. </p>
